# [Circles](https://github.com/photon-niko/circles/) Editor

This is a lil editor for [Circles](https://github.com/photon-niko/circles/) which is an esolang I'm trying to implement.

I made this to quickly make programs to test edge cases and stuff.

## How to use

Make new circles by pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard for each circle type.

| Key | Circle Type |
|-----|-------------|
| S   | Start       |
| N   | Normal      |
| I   | Increment   |
| D   | Decrement   |
| O   | Output      |
