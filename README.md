# [Circles](https://github.com/photon-niko/circles/) Editor

This is a lil editor for [Circles](https://github.com/photon-niko/circles/) which is an esolang I'm trying to implement.

I made this to quickly make programs to test edge cases and stuff.

## Where to use

You can git clone this project and run it yourself. 

You can also use [the HTML version](https://photon-niko.itch.io/circles-editor). 

## How to use

Make new circles by pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard for each circle type.

| Key | Circle Type |
|-----|-------------|
| `S` | Start       |
| `N` | Normal      |
| `I` | Increment   |
| `D` | Decrement   |
| `O` | Output      |

Left click to select circles or paths. While selecting two circles, make a new path by pressing the corresponding key for each path type.

| Key | Path Type   |
|-----|-------------|
| `N` | Normal      |
| `P` | Priority    |
| `I` | Input       |
| `C` | Conditional |

Press `X` to delete selected circles or paths.

Press `Enter` to save the program to an image.

> Note: Saving doesn't work on the HTML version, so feel free to screenshot :)
